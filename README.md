This system aims to implement basic banking functionalities, supporting multiple user roles, each with specific interfaces and commands to handle their respective operations.
1. Client Interface:
check_avl [bank_name] [account_number]: Displays the balance of the specified account in the specified bank. If the account or bank does not exist, an error message is shown.
open [bank_name]: Sends a request to the bank to open a new account, automatically including the client's name, personal ID number, and age.
close [bank_name] [account_number]: Sends a request to the bank to close the specified account. Invalid data results in an error message.
redeem [bank_name] [account_number] [verification_code]: Redeems a check and transfers the funds to the specified account upon code validation. Invalid checks result in an error message.
change [new_bank_name] [current_bank_name] [account_number]: Sends a request to transfer the specified account to a different bank.
list [bank_name]: Lists all accounts the client holds in the specified bank.

Clients have additional information such as address and records of redeemed checks.
5. System Interface:
login: Logs a user into the system.
